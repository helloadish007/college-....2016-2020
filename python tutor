PYTHON FEATURES:
-----------------
1.gui support
2.cross platform language
3.interpreted language
4.Python is a case-sensitive language
5.Python is a type inferred language;
-----------------------
Interpreter:	
============
Translates program one statement at a time.
Compiler:
=========
Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
-----------------------
COMMENTS:
----------
way to increase the readability of your code is by using comments!
EG:
1.using triple quotes 
"""
If I really hate pressing `enter` and
typing all those hash marks, I could
just do this instead
"""
2.using hash
#THIS IS A COMMENT
shorcut:select all text to be commented and ^ctrl +/
------------------------
PYTHON KEYWORDS
------------------------
Keywords are the reserved words in Python.
In Python, keywords are case sensitive.
EG:
False	class	return
None	continue	for	lambda	try
True	def	from	while
and	del	global	not	with
as	elif	if	or	yield
assert	else	import	pass	 
break	except	in	raise	
-------------------------
PYTHON IDENTIFIERS:
--------------------------
An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. 
It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
-------------------
Rules for writing identifiers:
==============================
1.Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _.
Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
2.An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is perfectly fine.
3.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
--------------------------
PYTHON VARIABLES:
----------------------
A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory.
-----------------------
PYTHON OPERATORS:
-----------------
Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.
The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
======================
1) +	 Add two operands or unary plus	x + y
+2
2) -	 Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus	x - y
-2
3) *	Multiply two operands	x * y
4) /	Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)	x / y
5) %	Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right	x % y (remainder of x/y)
6) //	Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line	x // y
7) **	Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right	x**y (x to the power y)

COMPARISON OPERATORS:
=====================
Comparison operators are used to compare values.
It either returns True or False according to the condition.

1) >	Greater that - True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
2) <	Less that - True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
3) ==	Equal to - True if both operands are equal	x == y
4) !=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
5) >=	Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
6) <=	Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y

LOGICAL OPERATORS:
==================
Logical operators are the and, or, not operators.

1) and	True if both the operands are true	x and y
2) or	True if either of the operands is true	x or y
3) not	True if operand is false (complements the operand)	not x
